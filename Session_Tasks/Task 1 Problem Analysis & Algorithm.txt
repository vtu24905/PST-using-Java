Task 1: Problem Analysis & Algorithm Design


Problem Statement:
Objective: Improve logical thinking before coding
Task:
Analyze the problem “Student Result Management System” and do the following:
1.	Identify inputs and outputs
2.	Write the algorithm
3.	Draw a flowchart
4.	List possible test cases

STEP 1: Understand the Problem
The system should:
Take student details
Take marks
Calculate total and average
Assign grade
Display result


STEP 2: Identify Inputs and Output:

1. Inputs:

Student Name
Roll Number
Number of Subjects
Marks of each subject

2. Outputs:

Total Marks
Average Marks
Grade
Result (Pass/Fail)

STEP 3: Algorithm:

Start
Input student name
Input roll number
Input number of subjects (n)
Set total = 0
Repeat the following steps n times:
a. Input marks
b. Add marks to total
If average ≥ 75 then grade = "A"
Else if average ≥ 60 then grade = "B"
Else if average ≥ 50 then grade = "C"
Else grade = "F"
If grade ≠ "F" then result = "Pass"
Else result = "Fail"
Display student details, total, average, grade and result
14. Stop

STEP 5: Write Test Cases

| Test Case | Marks      | Expected Grade | Result |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------ |
| TC1       | 80, 85, 90 | A              | Pass   |
| TC2       | 65, 70, 60 | B              | Pass   |
| TC3       | 50, 52, 55 | C              | Pass   |
| TC4       | 30, 40, 45 | F              | Fail   |
| TC5       | 75, 75, 75 | A              | Pass   |
